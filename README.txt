This is my project for SBA 316.  The theme of this web application is a basic NFL Fan Page.  There is an area for a visitor to enter their info to subscribe to a newsletter,  a section to list favorite teams and add favorite teams and an area that displays an upcoming game.  

While this is basic,  a further build-out of this site would include linkage to stats and news stories for favorite teams and perhaps a livecast/preview for listed games.  There is not variability in the list of teams or games as this site meets the minimum requirements for the project,  but further expansion of this project would include more interactivity and links to other resources pertaining to teams/games.
